This game is a 2D shooter which makes use of a 3d engine for smoother and more in depth camera perspectives. The mechanics
are simple, shoot and not get shot. The start screen presents 3 possible ships for the user to use, each of which has
different characteristics, including attack patterns, move speed, health, etc. The enemies too have individual sprites, 
attack patterns, firing rates and respawn rates. The controls include moving with arrow keys, space to fire, p to pause, 
r to restart, z to zoom in, x to zoom out, and enter to recall bullets for the viking mode. The game is divided into two
levels, each with very different objectives. The first level involves killing the boss, which is spawned in an empty room
with many supporting enemy ships that respawn at a high rate and spawn in a densely crowded area. This makes approaching
the boss difficult. There are walls, which block all projectiles except that of the viking. The map is designed to
provide cover spots where the user may hide and rest until more enemies spawn.
The second level involves a large room, which constantly spawns more and more enemies as time goes on. The purpose of this
level is to survive for 120 seconds, with the max number of enemies in the room increasing by 1 every 4 seconds.
The viking has special bullets which reflect off of all walls. however there may only be 10 bullets on the screen at once.
the wraith features fast movement and bullet speed, and a periodic, automatic triple laser.
the battlecruiser is a slow, double health, double laser ship.
